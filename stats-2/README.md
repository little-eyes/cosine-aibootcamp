# Basic Stats 2: Hypothesis Testing Homework

For this session, we translate some important parts in Swirl class into Python so you could know how the same thing can be implemented in Python. It breaks down into different sections similar to Swirl class. I would recommend you to go through the Swirl class first, then jump to here to see some Python implementation.

# COSINE AI Bootcamp Python Homework Examples

This repo is the python version of AI Bootcamp that we are going through in CDE this year. You are encouraged to clone this repo and run the Jupyter notebook locally to see the outcome.

To get started, you need to install python. We recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to install Python. 

Next, install all dependent python packages.
```console
$ python -m pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Then run Jupyter Lab to launch the browser, find the right session.
```console
$ jupyter lab
```
